### Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcel Garus (he/him), a student at the [<img src="https://hpi.de/typo3conf/ext/hpi_distribution/Resources/Public/Default/img/HPI-Favicon-33x33.png" alt="HPI" width="16" height="16"> **Hasso Plattner Institute**](https://hpi.de).

In the open-source world, I work mostly on low-level things such as Rust, Assembly, or Zig.
I love inventing new programming languages such as [Candy](https://github.com/candy-lang/candy), [Martinaise](https://github.com/MarcelGarus/martinaise), [Soil](https://github.com/MarcelGarus/soil), [Mehl](https://github.com/MarcelGarus/mehl), [Dungbeetle](https://github.com/MarcelGarus/dungbeetle).
Sometimes, I write articles on [my blog](https://marcelgarus.dev).
