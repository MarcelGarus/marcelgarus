### Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcel Garus (he/him), a student at the [<img src="https://hpi.de/typo3conf/ext/hpi_distribution/Resources/Public/Default/img/HPI-Favicon-33x33.png" alt="HPI" width="16" height="16"> **Hasso Plattner Institute**](https://hpi.de).

In the open-source world, I work mostly on low-level things such as Rust, Assembly, or Zig.
Most notably, together with [@JonasWanke](https://github.com/JonasWanke), I'm reinventing the wheel with a new programming language called [**Candy**](https://github.com/candy-lang/candy).
Sometimes, I write articles on [my blog](https://marcelgarus.dev).

ðŸ“« Don't hesitate to get in touch with me! You can reach me on [Telegram](https://t.me/marcelgarus) or via [other contact options](https://schreib.marcel.jetzt).
